# DaisyUI Themes

The frontend is styled with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). Two themes are enabled:

- `corporate` – used as the default light mode.
- `business` – used for dark mode.

When you build the frontend, Tailwind will generate the CSS for these themes automatically. Switch themes by setting `data-theme` on the `html` element at runtime.
